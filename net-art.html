				<h3> tomo cave </h3><p> date: 10/15/2019 </p>
				<p> for this project, i wanted to create a page that focused on the cuteness of my cat, momo, and my boyfriend's cat, tora. their names combined create "tomo". i compiled photos of the cats to be in the front and background. i also included a few videos of them that help show their "cuteness." </p>

				<h3> the web "test" </h3><p> date: 10/28/2019 </p>
				<p> this website was created to demonstrate how the internet is a source of "surveillance" as it tracks what you do based on the input information you give it. this website also embodies a few internet "trends" such as memes and asmr. in its own way, it is a form of "net art". as it allows its audience to actively interact with it. it was sort of difficult trying to figure out what to put on each page, but as I kept working with it, it turned into something very "playful" and "fun." there are a total of 4 outcomes when taking the "test." </p>

				<h3> UPlifting words </h3><p> date: 05/13/2020 </p>
				<p> this net art was created to be a space where people can read positive words/phrases as well as input their own for other to read as well, in hopes that people's spirits would be lifted up. this idea came about at the start of the covid-19 quarantine.unfortunately, i could not find a way to make the balloons go up instead of down. </p>
