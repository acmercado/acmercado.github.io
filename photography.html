				<p> shot with a canon rebel t6, 18-55mm, f/?, iso?, shutter speed: unlimited. light drawing made with the flash of our phones in the dark, shone towards the camera. the photo was not edited considering the shadow already helped the lights be more prominent; light also draws focus to the subject. </p>

				<h3> description/process: </h3><p> my boyfriend, josh, and his daughter/fur baby, tora. they are important family members of my life. though we are not related through blood, i consider them as a part of my family because of the bonds we share. </p>
				<p> shot with a canon rebel t6, 18-55mm, f/?, iso?, shutter speed: 1/60. subjects stood in front of a plain, white closet door. a light was shone onto them in the top right as i took my photo. as one can see, tora wanted to escape so josh resorted into trying to calm her down with kisses. the photo was edited in Adobe's Lightroom; the usual "color, saturation, lights, shadows, and exposure." </p>
