			<h3> artist statement </h3>
			<p> I am a Digital Media Artist based in Stockton, California. I am currently pursuing higher education at San Jose State University (SJSU) until the end of the Spring 2021 semester. Throughout my educational career at SJSU, I have obtained (and am continuously still learning) many tools and techniques of how to create art through softwares such as Atom, TouchDesigner, Fusion 360, Blender, Adobe's Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere, and PhotoShop. As an artist, I am still in the process of discovering my overall style but I enjoy expressing myself through my artworks. My pieces may convey, but are not limited to, ideas about the representation of my Filipino culture, my family, and my personal experiences. I am currently growing a main interest in video art, especially involving projections. However, I also enjoy creating pieces that are of 2D illustrations and 3D models. Although final products are definitely satisfying, I am also currently learning to love the process of making artworks as well as making time to revise some pieces in order to make them even better. My art journey is simply a mess, considering my experimentational relationship with art, but I am grateful to constantly find new ways of expressing myself through my art whilst also discovering who I am as an artist.
